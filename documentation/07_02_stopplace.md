# 7.2 StopPlace (SiteFrame)

## Functional description

A **StopPlace** represents a physical location where passengers may access the public transport system (rail station, funicular station, shuttle stop).  
It serves as the **spatial anchor** for all stop-related elements referenced across the dataset.

A StopPlace is the authoritative source for:
- The official name of the station or stop,
- Its coordinates,
- Its internal components (Quays, Entrances, etc.),
- Its public-facing identifiers.

StopPlaces are defined **exclusively** in the *SiteFrame* and referenced by other frames (ServiceFrame, TimetableFrame).

## Elements and attributes retained in the CFL MVP

| Element / Attribute | Description | Cardinality (CFL MVP) | Notes / Constraints |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| `@id` | Identifier of the StopPlace | 1..1 | Must follow CFL identifier scheme (see 5.1). |
| `Name` | Public name of the stop or station | 1..1 | Name may contain one or more &lt;Text&gt; elements with xml:lang, allowing multilingual names. |
| `ShortName` | Optional short label | 0..1 | Used only if stable and meaningful. |
| `PublicCode` | Public-facing code | 0..1 | Unique if present (e.g. mnemonic code). |
| `Centroid/Location` | Geographic coordinates (WGS84) | 1..1 | Mandatory latitude/longitude. |
| `StopPlaceType` | Type of location | 1..1 | Typically `railStation`, `multimodalStopPlace`, etc. |
| `Quays` | List of quays belonging to the StopPlace | 1..n | At least one quay required. |
| `AccessibilityAssessment` | Accessibility summary | 0..1 | Not detailed in MVP (WP3 extension). |
| `TopographicPlaceRef` | Reference to locality | 0..1 | Optional, used if available. |
| `ParentSiteRef` | Hierarchical parent | 0..1 | Used for nested structures (optional). |

### Notes
- Attributes not listed above are not used in the CFL MVP.
- Additional details (equipment, entrances, accessibility) may be added in later work packages.

## CFL-specific modelling rules

### Names
- **Name** must reflect the official published station name.  
- Accents and hyphens are allowed.  
- If multilingual names are provided, they must be equivalent.

### Identifiers
- Must follow the format:  
  **`LU:CFL:StopPlace:<LocalId>`**  
  e.g., `LU:CFL:StopPlace:SP00032`.

- Identifiers never change, even when the name is updated.

### Coordinates
- Coordinates must be WGS84 decimal degrees.  
- Coordinates represent the *logical centre* of the station (not the platform).

### Quays
- Every StopPlace must contain **at least one** Quay.  
- Quays must be defined within the same SiteFrame.  
- Quay identifiers must be globally unique.

## Minimal XML example (illustrative only)

⚠️ *This example is illustrative. Identifiers, names, coordinates and codes are not real CFL production data.*

```xml
<StopPlace id="LU:CFL:StopPlace:SP00032" version="1">
    <Name>Luxembourg Gare Centrale</Name>
    <Centroid>
        <Location>
            <Longitude>6.1333</Longitude>
            <Latitude>49.5995</Latitude>
        </Location>
    </Centroid>
    <StopPlaceType>railStation</StopPlaceType>

    <Quays>
        <QuayRef ref="LU:CFL:Quay:LuxGare-1" version="1"/>
        <QuayRef ref="LU:CFL:Quay:LuxGare-2" version="1"/>
    </Quays>
</StopPlace>
```

## Summary

The StopPlace is the foundational spatial object of the CFL timetable dataset.
It provides the authoritative definition of each station or stop, including:

- Stable identifier,
- Public name(s),
- Coordinates,
- Associated quays.

All other frames reference these elements through identifiers, ensuring consistency across the entire dataset.
